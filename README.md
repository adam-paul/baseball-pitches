<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a simple PHP website I made for myself to learn a little more about baseball âš¾. Pitching is like 90% of the game, so I figured if I could recognize the pitches as they're thrown, I could enjoy the games a little more. And it worked! I have grown to really enjoy watching baseball games : )

### Project File Structure

The project structure is very simple and is the standard file structure for a website. Here is the directory structure for the project:

![Directory_Screen_Short][directory-screenshot]

For this site there is one webpage, "index.php", that imports three PHP fragments. 

#### The Files:

* index.php (homepage)
* ___pitch-selector.php
* ___navigation.php
* ___config.php

**Homepage:**

The one and only webpage in this project is named "index.php".

Note: the default webpage that is shown when the domain name is entered in the address bar is always the file named "index". This is true for all websites.

**PHP Fragments:**

There are three PHP fragment files that are imported into the homepage. These fragments use the naming convention of having the file name prepended with three underscores, like "___config.php".

For this project, seperating the code into three PHP fragment files was done for readability. But in larger, multi-page projects, it's also done for reusability. Like for showing the same menu across multiple pages. So if you have to make a change to the menu, you only have to make it in one file, the menu fragment file.

#### The Directories:

* css/
   * Contains the CSS files for styling the site
* images/
   * Contains the images used for the site and also for this README file
* js/
   * Contains a JavaScript file

### Webpage Design

The webpage consists of a full screen YouTube video and a side navigation menu for choosing the different types of pitches to show. When the user selects a pitch type from the side nav, the same "index.php" page reloads, and the selected pitch type appears in the address bar as a url parameter, like "pitch=1". Then the "___pitch_selector.php" fragment determines which video reel to show based on that pitch number.

### Built With

These are the major frameworks/libraries used in the project.

<!-- DOWNLOADING THE SOURCE CODE -->
## Downloading The Source Code

There are two ways to get the source code on your computer.

1. If you have Git installed on your machine, you can clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ajaydhar1/baseball-pitches.git
   ```
2. Or you can just download the project:
   
   1. Click the green Code button on the top right of the screen
   2. Select "Download ZIP"


<!-- CONFIGURING THE CODE FOR YOUR OWN USE -->
## Configuring The Code For Your Own Use

Modifying the project to make it your own is very easy. I have externalized three variables into the file "___config.php" (for configuration). These variables are the only things you need to change, at a minimum, to personalize the site as your own.

The three variables are:

1. $site_name = "Baseball Pitches"; ----- (What you want to name your site)
2. $site_domain = "baseball-pitches.com"; ----- (The domain name you purchased for the site)
3. $ga_measurement_id = "G-XXXXXXXXXX"; ----- (The Google Analytics Measurement ID for tracking the users on your site)

Since you have the full source code under your control, you can make more changes too, like to the CSS styling, or the contents of the navigation menu.

You can even change the main YouTube video and purpose of the site from baseball pitching to something else. It all depends on your comfort level and requirements.

<!-- GETTING YOUR SITE ONLINE -->
## Getting Your Site Online

There are a few steps you need to take to put the site online. I am listing them here:

1. Buy a domain name from a site like GoDaddy.com ([instructions](https://www.godaddy.com/how-to/real-tips-from-real-guides/how-to-buy-a-domain-with-godaddy))
   * I recommend getting Full Domain Protection so people can't look up your name and address based on the domain name
   * Also, uncheck "Start your website for FREE"
3. Sign up for a hosting plan from a site like Hostinger.com ([instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8OwGRqmdMs) - Stop at 2:15 into the video!! Unlike they say in the video, I recommend you do not buy the domain through Hostinger! I like keeping all my domains in one place at GoDaddy)
4. Point your domain name at GoDaddy to your website account at Hostinger [(instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7M1p3ExdfM))
5. Create a Google Analytics account for your new domain name ([instructions - step 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybK-VUAxZ_8))([instructions - step 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYdRHSH2l8k) - Stop at 0:38 into the video!! You can see the Measurement ID in the top right of the screen. Copy that for Step 6.
6. Update the configuration file "___config.php" in the project as mentioned above. Update the site name, site domain (from Step 1), and Google Analytics Measurement ID (from Step 5)
7. Connect to your hosting provider using FileZilla and upload the project files into the "public_html" folder ([instructions for connecting FileZilla to Hostinger account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efgPQw0Aq2A)])
   * When you connect to Hostinger using FileZilla, your computer's directory structure is on the left and the server's directory structure is on the right. On the left, navigate to your project folder. On the right, you should click on the public_html folder (this is where your website files will live). Then just select all the files from your project folder on the left, and drag and drop them into the public_html folder on the right. That's it : )
8. Test your site by opening a browser and typing your domain name in the address bar.
